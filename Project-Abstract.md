This project demonstrates how Observational Astronomy and Computational Astronomy go hand in hand. 
We observe the space using the Horn Antennas that we construct in Space Science and Astronomy Lab. 
We then process the obtained data using Signal Processing Techniques and also use ML models to help us along the journey. 
Some of the objectives of the project include: signal processing of radio waves; 
Fourier Transform theory, corrections, filters, and RTL-SDR devices; 
Astropy, Scipy, and machine learning models for radio signals classification; 
collecting observations from RTL-SDR Horn Antenna; 
combining radio signals from 2 different horn antennas and applying signal processing techniques.
